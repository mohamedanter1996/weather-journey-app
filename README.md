# Weather-Journal App Project
This is my second project, and I hope to be successful in using the tools that I learned to implement what is required of me in this project.
## Overview
### I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
### I made some modifying to HTML and CSS files to make the layout more simple as I can.
### I wrote comments to make the code more readable.

## Instructions
### All you should do is write the ZIP code of the city (United States).
### You can write your feelings.
### The application will show you.
  - the name of the city. 
  - the temperature.
  - the date.
  - description of weather.
  - your feelings.
